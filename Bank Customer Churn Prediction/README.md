### Aim: 
Classify Churn in Bank Data- Explore REGRESSIONS

### Data Source: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction?resource=download&select=Churn_Modelling.csv <br>
It is the dataset of a U.S. bank customer for getting the information that, this particular customer will leave bank or not.

### Models Implemented:
1. Logistic Regression
2. LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) 
3. QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis)
4. KNN (K Nearest Neighbours)

### Process
Each of the different models were developed after normalizing the data using "centre and scaling" and creating train and test sets. The models were compared based on Type 1 and Type 2 errors, sensitivity and specificity along with accuracy value. The best out of all the models were chosen as a good fit to classigy customer churn. The best model out of Logistic, LDA, QDA and KNN turned out to be KNN.
